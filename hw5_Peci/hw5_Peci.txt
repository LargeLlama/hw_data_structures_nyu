Formula - next = (a * cur + b) % n
next = (12 * 92 + 5) % 100 = 9
next = (12 * 9 + 5) % 100 = 13
next = (12 * 13 + 5) % 100 = 61
next = (12 * 61 + 5) % 100 = 37
next = (12 * 37 + 5) % 100 = 49

Node secondLast(Node u) {
	if(u == null || u.next == null)

	Node tmp = u;
	while(tmp.next.next != null) {
		tmp = tmp.next;

A.2
To find the middle of a doubly linked list with sentinel nodes, you have two traversal nodes, one starting from the head and the other starting from the tail. The one starting from the head goes to the next one, and the one from the tail goes to the previous one. This keeps going until the traversals fall on the same node, or the head's next node is the tail one. Then, stop the loop and return the node that started from the header.

Pseudo code:
front = head sentinel.next
back = tail sentinel.prev
while (front != back && front.next != back)
	front = front.next
	back = back.prev

return front
