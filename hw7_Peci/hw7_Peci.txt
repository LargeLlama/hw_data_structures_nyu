A.1
R-9.10
In a min heap, you can find the third smallest key at the first level, or the children of the parent node, since that subtree will have, at minimum, 3 keys, and one of them will be the third lowest.

In a max heap, the third smallest key would be somewhere in the lowest level.

R-9.11
In a min heap, the largest key would be stored on the very bottom level of the tree.
In a max heap, the largst key would be stored at the root.

int ht(Bnode2 u) {
	if(u == null) {
		return -1;
	else {
		int leftHeight = ht(u.left);
		int rightHeight = ht(u.right);

		if (leftHeight > rightHeight)
			return leftHeight + 1;
		else
			return rightHeight + 1;
	}
}

Node split(Node u) {
	if u is null or u.next is null
		return u
	else
		Node tmp = u
		int length = 0
